# 📁 Folder Statistics Utility (utils/folder_stats.py)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:             Calculates file counts and total size of image directories for reporting
# Project:             RMI 360 Imaging Workflow Python Toolbox
# Version:             1.1.0
# Author:              RMI Valuation, LLC
# Created:             2025-05-08
# Last Updated:        2025-05-14
#
# Description:
#   Recursively walks a given directory to count image files (default: .jpg) and compute their
#   cumulative size. Formats byte totals into human-readable strings using `humanize`. Used for
#   reporting logs and disk space estimation in enhancement and renaming steps.
#
# File Location:        /utils/folder_stats.py
# Called By:            utils/check_disk_space.py, reporting
# Int. Dependencies:    None
# Ext. Dependencies:    os, humanize, pathlib
#
# Documentation:
#   See: docs_legacy/UTILITIES.md
#   (Ensure this doc is current; update if needed.)
#
# Notes:
#   - Recursively matches any extensions provided via argument (default: ['.jpg'])
#   - Skips invalid or missing folders gracefully (returns 0 count and "0 B")
