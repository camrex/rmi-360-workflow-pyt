# üì¶ Report Data Builder (utils/report_data_builder.py)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:             Initializes, loads, and saves report data structures for the 360¬∞ workflow
# Project:             RMI 360 Imaging Workflow Python Toolbox
# Version:             1.0.0
# Author:              RMI Valuation, LLC
# Created:             2025-05-08
#
# Description:
#   Builds a structured JSON-compatible dictionary to track workflow progress, AWS info, camera metadata,
#   image paths, and summary metrics. Includes logic for resolving dynamic config expressions and provides
#   helper functions to persist and reload report data from disk.
#
# File Location:        /utils/report_data_builder.py
# Called By:            orchestrator, generate_report.py, progress dashboard
# Int. Dependencies:    expression_utils, arcpy_utils
# Ext. Dependencies:    os, json, pathlib, typing
#
# Documentation:
#   See: docs_legacy/UTILITIES.md and docs_legacy/tools/process_360_orchestrator.md
#
# Notes:
#   - Supports fallback-safe resolution of config.project.* expressions
#   - Creates report folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist
