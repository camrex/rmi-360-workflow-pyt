# ðŸ§­ Path Resolution Helpers (utils/path_resolver.py)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:             Resolves relative paths against the config file or toolbox root
# Project:             RMI 360 Imaging Workflow Python Toolbox
# Version:             1.0.0
# Author:              RMI Valuation, LLC
# Created:             2025-05-08
#
# Description:
#   Provides utility functions to resolve relative file paths in a consistent and portable way.
#   Supports resolution relative to the source configuration file (`__source__`) or to the
#   toolboxâ€™s root directory for bundled deployment. Ensures platform-independent path handling.
#
# File Location:        /utils/path_resolver.py
# Called By:            config_loader.py, expression_utils.py, deploy_lambda_monitor.py
# Int. Dependencies:    None
# Ext. Dependencies:    pathlib, typing
#
# Documentation:
#   See: docs/UTILITIES.md
#
# Notes:
#   - Uses pathlib for robust cross-platform path operations
#   - Designed to work both in development and inside ArcGIS Pro deployments

    Resolves a path relative to the directory of the loaded configuration file.
