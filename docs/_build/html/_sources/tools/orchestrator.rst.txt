Orchestrator
============

*This section is under development. Content will be migrated from the legacy documentation.*

The orchestrator provides automated end-to-end workflow execution:

- **Process Mosaic 360 Workflow** - Runs the complete workflow from raw video to published OID service

The orchestrator executes all individual tools in the correct sequence with a single tool run.

For detailed information, see the :doc:`../api/tools` API reference and the legacy documentation in ``docs_legacy/TOOL_GUIDES.md``.
