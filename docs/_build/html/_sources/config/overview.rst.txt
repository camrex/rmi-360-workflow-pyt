Configuration Overview
====================

This section covers the comprehensive configuration system used by the RMI 360 Imaging Workflow.

The workflow uses YAML-based configuration files that control all aspects of processing, from basic project settings to advanced AWS integration.

Configuration Files
-------------------

The main configuration files are:

- ``config.yaml`` - Main project configuration (created from sample)
- ``config.sample.yaml`` - Template with all available options
- ``esri_oid_fields_registry.yaml`` - Field definitions for OID schema

For detailed configuration information, see:

- :doc:`project-settings` - Project metadata and basic settings
- :doc:`aws-settings` - AWS S3 and Lambda configuration  
- :doc:`field-registry` - OID field schema definitions

Configuration sections are documented in detail in the :doc:`../user-guide/configuration` guide.
