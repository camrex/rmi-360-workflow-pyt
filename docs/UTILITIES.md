# üß∞ Shared Utilities ‚Äì RMI 360 Imaging Workflow Python Toolboxx

This guide explains the utility functions and helpers that power nearly every tool in the Mosaic 360 Toolbox. These are mostly located in the `utils/` directory and are reused across tools, orchestrators, and validation scripts.

## üìã Logging: `log_message()`

### Location: `utils/logging_utils.py`
Unified logging function used throughout the toolbox.

```python
log_message("Process started...", level="info", messages=messages)
```

- Outputs to ArcGIS `messages` if available
- Falls back to `print()` for CLI use
- Supports: `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, `"success"` levels

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config Load & Resolution

### `prepare_config()`
- Loads and expands `config.yaml`
- Automatically sets `__project_root__`
- Resolves any `config["..."]` paths relative to config location

### `resolve_config()`
- Entry point for tools that need to support various config loading modes

### `get_camera_offset_values()`
- Computes Z offset and camera height based on:
  ```yaml
  camera_offset:
    z: -7.5
    camera_height: 67.5
  ```

## üß† Expression Resolution

### Location: `utils/expression_utils.py`

Used for resolving dynamic expressions in filenames, metadata, and custom fields.

- `resolve_expression(expr, row, config)` ‚Äî main resolver
- `resolve_field_expr()` ‚Äî parses `field.AcquisitionDate.date(...)`
- `resolve_config_expr()` ‚Äî parses `config.project.slug.strip("-")`

Supports chaining, functions, and date formatting.

## üìÅ Path Utilities

### `get_log_path(log_key, config)`
- Resolves a log path based on `logs.path` and optional prefix
- Uses `resolve_expression()` to evaluate `logs.prefix`

### `resolve_relative_to_config(config, relative_path)`
- Converts a path like `templates/oid_schema_template` into an absolute path relative to the config file‚Äôs directory.

### `resolve_relative_to_pyt(relative_path)`
- Resolves path relative to the toolbox root (e.g., for `templates/`, lambdas, etc.)

---

## ‚è≥ Progress Feedback

### `Progressor` context manager
```python
with Progressor(label="Uploading images...", total=500) as prog:
    prog.update(i)
```
- Updates ArcGIS Pro‚Äôs progress bar if available
- Falls back to simple CLI counter

---

## üßæ CSV and EXIF Helpers

### `write_csv(path, rows, headers)`
