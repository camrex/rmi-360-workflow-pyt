Field Registry
==============

*This section is under development. Content will be migrated from the legacy documentation.*

The field registry system defines OID schema fields including:

- Field names, types, and properties
- Default values and calculations
- Field aliases and descriptions
- Validation rules

The registry is defined in ``configs/esri_oid_fields_registry.yaml``.

For now, see the legacy documentation in ``docs_legacy/`` for field registry details.
