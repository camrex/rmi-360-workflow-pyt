# 🧰 RMI 360 Imaging Workflow Python Toolbox

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.3.0-blue) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%2B-blue) ![ArcGIS Pro](https://img.shields.io/badge/ArcGIS_Pro-3.4|3.5-green) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-sphinx-blue)](https://camrex.github.io/rmi-360-workflow-pyt/)

A modular workflow built with ArcGIS Python Toolbox for processing and deploying 360° corridor imagery.

Optimized for Mosaic 51 cameras, with planned support for Insta360. Includes tools for OID creation, AWS publishing, and detailed reporting.

> **❗ ArcGIS Pro Note:** When adding the Toolbox to ArcGIS Pro, you may see a warning icon (❗) upon loading. If this occurs, simply remove the Toolbox and add it again to resolve the issue.

New: The `rmi_360_env_checker.pyt` toolbox is now included to check for all required Python libraries in your ArcGIS Pro environment before running the main tools.

*Tested using ArcGIS Pro 3.4.3 and 3.5.4.* Be sure to check that your ArcGIS Pro Python Environment has the dependencies in requirements.txt

> ℹ️ The “Oriented Imagery” tools require **Standard or Advanced** licenses. All other functions are available with **Basic** or higher.
> **⚠️ Unit Tests Note:** Many unit tests may currently be broken due to some bug fixes in this release.

## 📦 Overview

- 🎞️ Processes captured imagery using Mosaic Processor (with support for MistikaVR or MosaicStitcher)
- 🧭 ArcGIS Oriented Imagery Dataset (OID) creation and enrichment
- 🏷️ EXIF metadata tagging
- 🛣️ Linear referencing support for image positioning
- 🧩 Custom attributing based on config-driven logic
- 🌍 Geocoding of image locations using spatial reference datasets
- 🗂️ File renaming and organization
- ☁️ AWS S3 upload with resumable transfer logic
- 📈 Lambda-based progress monitoring and status dashboard
- 📊 HTML & JSON reporting of process steps and status

> **⚠️ Image Enhancement Removed:** Post-stitch image enhancement has been removed due to technical limitations that caused visible seam lines in panoramic imagery. Enhancement should occur before or during the stitching process for optimal results.

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Toolbox Structure      | Built as an ArcGIS `.pyt` Toolbox + modular tool wrappers & utilities       |
| Config-Driven          | YAML-based config with expression resolution and field registries           |
| AWS Integration        | Upload to S3 with TransferManager + Lambda schedule tracking                |
| Resumable Transfers    | Upload interruption protection + log recovery                               |
| HTML & JSON Reporting  | Auto-generated step summaries and final status reports                      |
| Image Metadata Support | Auto tag EXIF metadata + rename by GPS, time, reel, frame, etc.             |

Secured storage status: publishing now passes virtual_cache_directory when secured_storage.enabled is true.
End-to-end secured-storage serving on Enterprise 12.0 is still blocked by Esri Case #04187998.
Legacy public-URL mode remains the supported path until the Esri issue is resolved.

## ✅ Quick Start (Dev Mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camrex/rmi-360-workflow-pyt.git
cd rmi-360-workflow-pyt

# Copy and edit config
cp configs/config.sample.yaml configs/config.yaml
```

## 🧭 ArcGIS Pro Environment Setup

1. Open **ArcGIS Pro** and load a project (.aprx).
2. **Verify Python Environment:**
   In the Catalog pane, right-click **Toolboxes** → **Add Toolbox**, and add `rmi_360_env_checker.pyt`.
   Run the **Check Required Python Packages** tool to ensure all required libraries are installed.
   *If any libraries are missing, install them using the Python Command Prompt or the ArcGIS Pro Package Manager before proceeding.*

3. **Add the Workflow Toolbox:**
   Again in the Catalog pane, right-click **Toolboxes** → **Add Toolbox**, and add `rmi_360_workflow.pyt`.

4. **Access the Toolbox Tools:**
   Tools are grouped under:
   - **Setup**
   - **Individual Tools**
   - **Orchestrator**

5. Use individual tools or run the full pipeline with `ProcessMosaic360Workflow`.

## 🎞 Mosaic Processor Usage Notes

- The `RunMosaicProcessorTool` wraps the Mosaic CLI (requires Mosaic Processor + MistikaVR).
- It executes two passes:
  - Image rendering and reel fixing
  - GPX integration to embed GPS
- Requires `.grp` calibration file (provided by Mosaic) and raw `.mp4` input folders.
