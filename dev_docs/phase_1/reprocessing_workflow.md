# üîÑ Reprocessing and Selective Workflow Execution

## **üìñ Overview**
This task aims to enable selective reprocessing of images or steps in the pipeline. It focuses on allowing users to run only the necessary steps without redoing the entire processing workflow. This feature will improve efficiency and save computational resources.

**Objective**: Empower users to choose specific steps (such as metadata application or stitching) or images for reprocessing without triggering the whole pipeline.

## **üéØ Objectives**
- **Selective Reprocessing**: Allow users to select specific steps or images for reprocessing.
- **Non-Destructive Updates**: Ensure that metadata or images can be updated without affecting the entire dataset.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Save on computational resources by reprocessing only the necessary components.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Action Items**
### 1. **Develop Reprocessing Tool**
   - **Task**: Create a **tool** that allows users to select specific steps (e.g., metadata application, stitching) or images for reprocessing.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The tool should allow users to specify the part of the workflow they wish to run again.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Design Reprocessing Tool | Architect the tool that allows step-based selection for reprocessing | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement User Interface | Develop an intuitive UI for users to select images/steps | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Integrate with Pipeline | Ensure the tool works seamlessly with the existing pipeline | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 2. **Metadata Restoration Functionality**
   - **Task**: Implement a function to restore metadata from the database to images without altering their processing.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Ensure that metadata can be applied without re-running the entire image processing.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Design Metadata Restoration Logic | Create the logic for metadata restoration from the database to image files | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Metadata Updates | Allow users to apply metadata to images post-processing without impacting other data | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 3. **Integrate Step Selection**
   - **Task**: Enable users to select which processing steps to execute based on the image state (raw vs. final).
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users will be able to run specific steps without triggering the whole workflow.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Develop Step Selection Logic | Implement logic to check image state and allow specific steps | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Test Step Functionality | Test that only the selected steps run without affecting others | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

## **üìÖ Timeline**

| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| **Week 1-2** | Develop the core reprocessing tool, including UI design. |
| **Week 3** | Integrate step selection and metadata restoration features. |
| **Week 4** | Testing and validation of reprocessing tool functionality. |

---

## **üéØ Milestones**

| Milestone | Expected Completion |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **M1**: Tool design completed | Week 2 |
| **M2**: Metadata restoration functionality implemented | Week 3 |
| **M3**: Step selection logic integrated and tested | Week 3 |
| **M4**: Full tool testing and validation | Week 4 |

## **üß© Dependencies**
- **Reprocessing Tool** needs to be developed before metadata restoration and step selection features can be implemented.
- **Database integration** is required to allow metadata restoration functionality.
