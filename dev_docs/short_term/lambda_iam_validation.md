# üîë Lambda IAM Role Validation

## **üìñ Overview**
**Objective**: Implement checks to verify that the correct **IAM roles and permissions** are set up before deploying AWS Lambda functions. This task will ensure that Lambda functions have the necessary permissions to interact with other AWS services securely, preventing permission errors during deployment.

**Objective**: To create a Lambda IAM role validation function that ensures all required permissions are correctly configured before Lambda functions are deployed, reducing deployment issues related to IAM permissions.

---

## **üéØ Objectives**
- **Objective 1**: Implement an IAM validation function that checks the required IAM roles for Lambda deployment.
- **Objective 2**: Add error handling to ensure that missing or incorrect IAM roles are flagged and reported during deployment.
- **Objective 3**: Integrate IAM validation checks into the Lambda deployment process to prevent errors and ensure smooth operation.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Action Items**
### 1. **Define Required IAM Roles and Permissions**
   - **Task**: Determine the IAM roles and permissions required for Lambda functions to interact with services like **S3**, **DynamoDB**, etc.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A list of roles and permissions that need to be validated during the Lambda deployment process.

| Action | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Define IAM Roles | List all IAM roles and associated permissions required for Lambda functions | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
| Document Permissions | Specify the exact permissions required for different AWS services (e.g., read/write access to S3) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 2. **Implement IAM Role Validation Function**
   - **Task**: Write the function to validate the IAM roles and permissions, checking for any missing or misconfigured roles.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A Lambda function that checks IAM roles against the required configuration, ensuring proper permissions before deployment.
   
| Action | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Implement IAM Validator | Write the code to validate IAM roles and permissions | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
| Handle Missing Permissions | Implement error handling to notify the user of missing or incorrect permissions | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 3. **Integrate IAM Validation into Lambda Deployment Process**
   - **Task**: Integrate the IAM validation function into the existing Lambda deployment workflow to automatically check roles before deploying.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Ensure that IAM validation is part of the Lambda deployment process to prevent any IAM-related errors during function execution.

| Action | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Update Lambda Deployment Process | Integrate IAM validation into the Lambda deployment script | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
| Test Integration | Test the deployment process to ensure IAM validation occurs before Lambda functions are deployed | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 4. **Test and Validate IAM Role Validation Functionality**
   - **Task**: Thoroughly test the IAM validation function to ensure it correctly detects missing or incorrect IAM roles and permissions during Lambda deployment.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Verified IAM role validation that prevents Lambda deployment from continuing with incorrect IAM settings.
   
| Action | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Test with Correct IAM Roles | Validate deployment with correctly configured IAM roles | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
| Test with Missing or Incorrect Roles | Simulate missing or incorrect IAM roles to test error handling | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
| Validate Error Handling | Ensure error messages are clear and actionable for the user | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
