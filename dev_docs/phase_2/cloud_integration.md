# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Integration for Metadata Management and Reprocessing

## **üìñ Overview**
This task focuses on integrating cloud services, specifically **AWS** (using services like **S3**, **Lambda**, and **RDS**), to manage metadata and enable automated reprocessing of images. By moving these components to the cloud, we can handle larger datasets, streamline workflows, and reduce local processing burdens.

**Objective**: Enable scalable cloud-based metadata storage and reprocessing automation using AWS services, improving performance and resource efficiency.

---

## **üéØ Objectives**
- **Cloud-Based Metadata Management**: Migrate metadata storage to **AWS RDS** for improved scalability and centralized access.
- **Automated Reprocessing**: Use **AWS Lambda** to trigger reprocessing tasks when new data is uploaded to **S3**.
- **Integration with Existing Pipeline**: Ensure the cloud services work seamlessly with the current image processing pipeline.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Action Items**
### 1. **Migrate Metadata to AWS RDS**
   - **Task**: Migrate the **SQLite database** to **AWS RDS** to store metadata in a cloud-native database.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Centralized, scalable metadata storage that is easily accessible from anywhere.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Set up AWS RDS Instance | Create and configure an RDS instance for metadata storage | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Migrate Database Schema | Move the current SQLite schema to AWS RDS | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Integrate Pipeline with RDS | Update the pipeline to pull metadata from RDS | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 2. **Automate Metadata Updates with AWS Lambda**
   - **Task**: Set up **AWS Lambda** functions that automatically trigger when new data is uploaded to **S3**. These functions will update metadata or initiate image reprocessing as needed.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Efficient, serverless reprocessing that automatically kicks off when new data is available.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define Lambda Triggers | Set up **S3 event triggers** to activate Lambda on new uploads | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Lambda Functions | Write Lambda functions to handle metadata update and image reprocessing | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Integrate with Existing Pipeline | Ensure Lambda triggers interact smoothly with the current image processing pipeline | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 3. **Integrate Cloud-Based Reprocessing into Workflow**
   - **Task**: Modify the current pipeline to leverage **AWS** for reprocessing tasks like stitching, metadata application, or other steps.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Move heavy processing to the cloud, reducing the load on local machines.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Design Cloud Reprocessing Workflow | Define which parts of the pipeline will run in the cloud (e.g., stitching) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Cloud Processing | Use **AWS Batch** or **AWS Fargate** to run reprocessing jobs | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Test Cloud-Based Processing | Ensure the cloud workflow works seamlessly with existing tools | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

## **üìÖ Timeline**

| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| **Week 1-2** | Set up AWS RDS for metadata storage, implement Lambda triggers. |
| **Week 3** | Develop Lambda functions for metadata updates and image reprocessing. |
| **Week 4** | Integrate cloud reprocessing into the image processing pipeline. |
| **Week 5** | Test and validate the cloud-based metadata management and reprocessing system. |

---

## **üéØ Milestones**

| Milestone | Expected Completion |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **M1**: AWS RDS instance and schema set up | Week 2 |
| **M2**: Lambda triggers and functions implemented | Week 3 |
| **M3**: Cloud-based reprocessing integrated into pipeline | Week 4 |
| **M4**: Full system testing and validation | Week 5 |

---

## **üß© Dependencies**
- **AWS setup** (RDS and Lambda) needs to be completed before metadata migration and reprocessing can occur.
- Cloud-based processing relies on the integration with existing pipeline tools.
