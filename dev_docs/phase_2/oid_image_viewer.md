# üåê Web-Based OID + Image Preview Viewer

## **üìñ Overview**
This task focuses on developing a **web-based viewer** that allows users to preview **Oriented Imagery Datasets (OID)** and images, along with associated metadata. The goal is to provide a flexible and accessible solution for viewing and interacting with processed imagery outside of ArcGIS.

**Objective**: To create a **web-based viewer** that provides remote access to OID and image data, enabling users to interact with metadata and images directly from the cloud or any accessible web platform.

---

## **üéØ Objectives**
- **Web-Based Access**: Enable remote access to OID and image previews via a web browser.
- **Metadata Display**: Show metadata associated with images, such as acquisition date, GPS coordinates, and other relevant details.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure the viewer integrates smoothly with the existing system, especially with cloud-hosted images.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Action Items**
### 1. **Design Web Viewer Interface**
   - **Task**: Design the layout and functionality for a **web-based viewer** that will display OID and images.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A user-friendly and responsive interface for viewing images and associated metadata.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define Viewer Layout | Create wireframes or mockups for the web viewer | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Front-End | Develop the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the viewer interface | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Make Viewer Responsive | Ensure the viewer works well across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 2. **Integrate Metadata with Image Previews**
   - **Task**: Integrate **metadata** such as GPS coordinates, acquisition time, and other relevant information with the image previews.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users can view detailed metadata for each image directly in the viewer.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define Metadata Fields | Determine which metadata fields to display (e.g., GPS, acquisition time, etc.) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Fetch Metadata from Cloud | Ensure metadata is pulled from the cloud (e.g., S3) and displayed alongside images | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Metadata Display | Display metadata clearly within the viewer interface | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 3. **Integrate Image Preview Functionality**
   - **Task**: Implement image preview functionality that loads images (from **S3** or local storage) directly in the web viewer.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users can preview images interactively in the viewer.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Image Viewer Integration | Implement the **Photo Sphere Viewer** or **WebGL-based viewer** for interactive image previews | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Image Navigation | Allow users to navigate through image collections (next/previous, zoom) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 4. **Host the Viewer and Ensure Accessibility**
   - **Task**: Host the viewer on a **web server** (e.g., AWS S3, EC2) and ensure it is publicly or privately accessible based on user requirements.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Ensure that users can access the viewer from anywhere via a browser.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Choose Hosting Platform | Determine where to host the viewer (AWS S3, EC2, etc.) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Access Controls | Set up access permissions for public or private access | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Deploy the Viewer | Deploy the viewer to the selected hosting platform | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

## **üéØ Milestones**

| Milestone | Expected Completion |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **M1**: Viewer layout and front-end developed | Week 1 |
| **M2**: Metadata integration complete | Week 2 |
| **M3**: Image preview functionality integrated | Week 2 |
| **M4**: Viewer hosted and tested for accessibility | Week 3 |
| **M5**: Final testing and cross-device compatibility | Week 4 |

---

## **üß© Dependencies**
- **Metadata**: The viewer relies on the metadata being available in cloud storage (e.g., S3).
- **Cloud Storage**: Access to the images must be ensured through **S3** or another cloud storage solution.
