# üëÅÔ∏è Standalone Viewer for Web and External Access

## **üìñ Overview**
This task focuses on developing a **standalone image viewer** that allows users to interact with **360-degree imagery** and metadata in a browser without relying on ArcGIS or any other specialized software. The viewer will support features like image navigation, zooming, and displaying metadata, providing a simple and flexible solution for image visualization and interaction.
