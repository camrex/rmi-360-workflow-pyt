# 📤 Cloud-Based Image Syncing and Publishing

## **📖 Overview**
This task focuses on automating the **uploading and syncing** of images and metadata to **cloud storage** (e.g., **AWS S3**) and ensuring that these assets are easily accessible. The goal is to provide a seamless process for syncing and publishing images, making them available for further processing, viewing, or sharing across different platforms.

**Objective**: To implement an efficient, automated system for syncing images and their metadata to the cloud, ensuring smooth workflow integration with existing tools and easy access for end users.

---

## **🎯 Objectives**
- **Automated Image Upload**: Automatically upload processed images and metadata to **S3** or other cloud platforms.
- **Sync and Publish**: Ensure images are synced properly with metadata, providing remote access for viewing or further processing.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging to ensure the upload process is reliable and transparent.

## **🛠️ Action Items**
### 1. **Set Up Cloud Storage Integration (AWS S3)**
   - **Task**: Set up an **AWS S3** bucket for storing images and metadata, ensuring it is ready for automated syncing.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A cloud storage solution that can store and retrieve images and metadata easily.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Create S3 Bucket | Set up an S3 bucket for image storage and metadata syncing | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Set Bucket Permissions | Configure access permissions for public or private access | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Define Folder Structure | Organize folders in S3 for image types (raw, enhanced, metadata) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 2. **Implement Image Upload Automation**
   - **Task**: Create a system that automatically uploads images to **S3** when they are processed or ready for publishing.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Images are uploaded without manual intervention, allowing for faster processing and sharing.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define File Naming Convention | Ensure images are named in a consistent format (e.g., `project_slug_YYYYMMDD.jpg`) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Upload Logic | Write logic to automatically upload images to S3 | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Set Upload Triggers | Configure triggers for when images are ready for upload (e.g., completion of processing) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 3. **Sync Metadata with Images**
   - **Task**: Ensure that metadata is synced with the images during the upload process, and stored in an accessible format.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Each image will have its associated metadata, which can be accessed through S3 or other storage systems.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Implement Metadata Sync | Ensure metadata is stored in **S3** alongside the images | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Link Metadata to Images | Create a method for linking metadata to corresponding images in S3 | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Use Metadata for Searching | Implement the ability to search and retrieve images by metadata (e.g., acquisition date, GPS coordinates) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Task**: Implement error handling and logging to ensure that any issues with image uploads or syncing are captured and can be addressed.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A transparent, error-resilient syncing process with clear logs for debugging and monitoring.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define Error Handling Protocol | Identify potential errors during syncing and establish handling protocols | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Logging | Implement logging for tracking upload success and failures | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Automate Notifications | Set up notifications for failed uploads or other issues | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
