# üöÄ Fully Automated Cloud-Based Pipeline

## **üìñ Overview**
This task aims to transition the image processing pipeline to a **fully automated cloud-based solution** using **AWS services** like **Step Functions**, **Fargate**, and **Batch**. The goal is to automate the entire workflow from image ingestion, through processing tasks (e.g., stitching, metadata application), and to publishing results in the cloud.

**Objective**: To implement an automated, scalable pipeline that can handle large image datasets with minimal manual intervention, leveraging cloud-based processing for efficiency and flexibility.

---

## **üéØ Objectives**
- **Automated Workflow**: Use **AWS Step Functions** to orchestrate the entire pipeline, automating each step from image ingestion to processing and publishing.
- **Scalable Processing**: Utilize **AWS Fargate** or **AWS Batch** for scalable, containerized image processing, enabling the pipeline to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Cloud-Native Solution**: Ensure the pipeline is cloud-native, eliminating the need for local hardware and making the system easily scalable.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Action Items**
### 1. **Design the Pipeline Architecture with AWS Step Functions**
   - **Task**: Design and implement the orchestration of the entire processing pipeline using **AWS Step Functions** to automate each stage.
   - **Expected Outcome**: An automated, orchestrated workflow that handles image ingestion, processing, and publishing without manual intervention.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define Pipeline Steps | Break down the image processing pipeline into distinct steps (ingestion, stitching, metadata application, etc.) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Step Functions Workflow | Set up AWS Step Functions to automate each stage of the pipeline | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Set up State Management | Ensure the Step Functions workflow handles state transitions and data between steps | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 2. **Set Up AWS Fargate or AWS Batch for Scalable Image Processing**
   - **Task**: Use **AWS Fargate** or **AWS Batch** to run image processing tasks in containers, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Scalable, on-demand processing that adjusts based on workload size.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Containerize Processing Tasks | Dockerize processing tasks such as stitching and metadata updates | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Configure AWS Fargate or Batch | Set up **Fargate** or **Batch** to run image processing containers | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Resource Management | Ensure processing tasks scale based on image load and resources | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 3. **Automate Image Ingestion and Publishing**
   - **Task**: Automate the process of **ingesting images** (via S3) and **publishing** results once processing is complete.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Fully automated image flow from ingestion to publishing, with no manual intervention.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Set Up Image Ingestion | Configure automatic image uploads to **S3** (via event triggers) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Configure Publishing | Set up automated publishing to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, ArcGIS Online) | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Integrate with Metadata | Ensure that processed images are tagged with relevant metadata for easy retrieval | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |

### 4. **Implement Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Task**: Implement comprehensive **error handling** and **logging** within the pipeline to ensure reliable operation and transparency.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A robust error-handling mechanism and logs for troubleshooting and monitoring.
   
   | Action | Description | Status |
   |--------|-------------|--------|
   | Define Error Handling Logic | Identify potential failure points and create error handling protocols | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Implement Logging | Set up logging to capture key events, successes, and failures in the pipeline | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
   | Monitor Pipeline Health | Use **CloudWatch** for monitoring the health of the pipeline and detecting failures | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-To--Do-lightgrey) |
