## [2025-05-23]
### üß∞ RMI 360 Environment Checker and other quality-of-life changes
#### Added
- Added `rmi_360_env_checker.pyt` to the repository to check for required libraries in the ArcGIS Pro Python environment. This utility does not affect workflow toolbox versioning.
- Added ArcGIS Pro license matrix (`docs_legacy/ARCGISPRO_LICENSE_REQUIREMENTS.md`) summarizing which ArcPy functions/classes require Basic, Standard, or Advanced licenses.
- Added note to README indicating that a Standard license or above is required for Oriented Imagery tools.

#### Removals/Deprecations
- Removed `humanize` package requirement. Replaced with a native Python function in `folder_stats.py` for human-readable file size formatting. The Toolbox now runs in the base ArcGIS Pro Python environment without extra dependencies.

---

## [v1.1.1] - 2025-05-22
### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fix Update
#### Added
- Added `OrientationAccuracy` as a standard field in `esri_oid_fields_registry.yaml` (per ArcGIS Pro 3.5 OID attribute updates).
- Added `verify_aws_credentials()` function to `aws_utils.py` for AWS credential verification.
- Added additional validation to fail early if proper AWS credentials are not provided.

#### Fixed
- Fixed indentation of `project.local_proj_wkid`. It needs to be a child of `project`. This caused failure in validation.
- Fixed a regression in configuration management where the project root directory path key was changed from `__project_root__` to `__project_base__`. This update restores the correct key (`__project_root__`) for full compatibility with workflow tools and logging.
- Updated the sample configuration so `geocoding.exiftool_geodb` now defaults to `default`, avoiding errors when the specialized `geolocation500` GeoDB is not present in templates. This improves out-of-the-box compatibility for new projects.
- Resolved bugs in `build_oid_schema.py` affecting OID generation and schema consistency.
- Fixed AWS credential verification in `copy_to_aws.py` to match the logic in `deploy_lambda_monitor.py`, which is now handled from `aws_utils.py`.This ensures that invalid or placeholder credentials are detected before any operations are attempted, improving reliability and error reporting.
- Fixed a bug in `generate_oid_service.py` where the OID was not duplicated with AWS urls.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note: ‚ö†Ô∏è**
> Version **v1.1.0** contained critical bugs that may render the workflow unusable.
> Please use version **v1.1.1** or later, which resolves these issues.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Unit Tests Note:** Many unit tests may currently be broken due to some bug fixes in this release.
